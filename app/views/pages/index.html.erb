			<p>Hello! I'm a Washington, DC-based Ruby on Rails web developer.</p>
		
			<p>After almost a decadle in online communications with a number of organizations in DC (The Brookings Institution, World Food Program USA, and the Biotechnology Industry Organization), I decided to switch over to coding. I am currently freelancing and interested in becoming a full-time web developer.</p>
		
			<p>This site includes some examples of my work.</p>

			<h2>TextBike.com</h2>

			<p>TextBike.com is the project I completed for my Back-End Web Development course with General Assembly. </p>

			<p>Ever end up going to your regular Bikeshare station for your daily commute only to find that tourists have snaked all the bikes? Yeah, me too...</p>

			<p>TextBike will text you 5-10 minutes before your regular commute time to let you know if your bikestation is precariously low on the number of available bikes.</p> 

			<p>It uses Twilio and Capital Bikeshare XML data to notify users when their bikestation is low on bikes.</p>
